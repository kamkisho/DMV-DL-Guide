      A red arrow means you must stop if you intend to
move in the direction of the arrow. You may not
proceed in the direction of the arrow as long
as the red arrow is displayed, unless signs are
posted at the intersection that read “Right on
Red Arrow After Stop” or “Left on Red Arrow
After Stop.” Virginia law prohibits right and left
turns at red arrow lights.
    <br> Note: If you are traveling in another state, make sure you know
its laws for right and left turns at red and red arrow lights. </p>

      At a flashing red light, come
to a complete stop and yield to oncoming
vehicles and pedestrians. You may go when the
way is clear. At a railroad crossing, you must
come to a complete stop even if you don’t see a
train. </p>
    <p> <b>Flashing red arrow: </b> At a flashing red arrow, come to a
    complete stop, yield the right-of-way to vehicles coming from
    the other direction and pedestrians in the intersection, and
    proceed in the direction of the arrow when the way is clear.</p>
