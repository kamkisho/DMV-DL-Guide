     A yellow light or arrow are cautions
    warning that the light is about to change. If you have not
    entered the intersection, stop;
    or, if unsafe to stop, cautiously
    go through it. If you are already
    in the intersection, go through it
    cautiously. Do not speed up to
    beat the light.</p>
    <p><b>Flashing yellow light:</b>

     A flashing yellow light
    means slow down and proceed with caution.
    Flashing yellow lights are at locations with
    higher-than-normal hazardous conditions.</p>
    <p><b>Flashing yellow arrow:</b>
     At a flashing yellow arrow, you may
    turn in the direction of the arrow, if the way is clear. Yield
    the right-of-way to vehicles coming from the other direction
    and pedestrians in the intersection. Be sure to check for less
    visible vehicles such as motorcycles, bicycles, and mopeds. If
    a traffic light changes from red to flashing yellow arrow while a
    pedestrian is in the intersection, allow the pedestrian to cross
    the street before turning.
