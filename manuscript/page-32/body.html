       Flashing lights
may be used with crossbuck signs. Always stop
when the light begins to flash and be alert for
approaching trains. Do not proceed until all
trains or any other vehicles using the rails have
passed, the tracks are clear, and the lights are
no longer flashing. Be especially alert at multitrack
crossings because a second train could be
approaching from the opposite direction.</p>

    <p><b>Crossbuck, Flashing Lights and Gate:</b>

      Gates are used with flashing light signals at some
crossings. Stop when the lights begin to flash and
before the gate lowers. Remain stopped until the
gates are raised and the lights stop flashing. Do
not attempt to drive around the
lowered gate.</p>

    <p>Pavement markings, consisting
      of an X and RR, may
      be painted on the
      pavement at the
      approach to some
      crossings.

      When approaching railroad
      tracks, be alert. Trains
      may approach the
      crossing at any time and
      from either direction.
      Unless you can clear the
      tracks completely, never
      start across the tracks.
      Make sure there is room for your vehicle on the other side of
      the tracks before proceeding.</p>
