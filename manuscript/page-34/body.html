      Flaggers are construction
workers who normally wear orange or
yellow vests, or yellow-green shirts or
jackets. They use STOP/SLOW paddles
and red flags to direct traffic through
the work zone and to let other workers
or construction vehicles cross the road.</p>

      Barricades, vertical signs, concrete
barriers, drums and cones are the
most common devices used to guide
drivers safely through work zones.
When driving near the devices, keep
your vehicle in the middle of the lane
and obey the posted speed limit. As
you leave the work zone, stay in your
lane and maintain your speed. Donâ€™t
change lanes until you are completely
clear of the work zone.
