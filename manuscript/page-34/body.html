    <p>Note: School buses must always stop at railroad crossings,
    even when the lights are not flashing.</p>

    <p>If a dangerous condition exists at a
    rail crossing, call the number listed on
    the emergency sign.

    This will allow
    the rail company to stop or reroute
    approaching rail traffic until the hazard
    is removed. Be sure to give the posted
    crossing number so that the hazard can
    be identified correctly.</p>

    <p>If your car
    stalls on the
    tracks, donâ€™t
    hesitate.

    Get out of the car
    right away and
    run diagonally
    away from the
    tracks in the
    direction of
    the oncoming
    train.</p>
