    <p><b> In a work zone,</b> the lives of highway construction workers
depend on drivers like you obeying the posted speed limits. If
you are convicted of exceeding the speed limit in a highway
work zone, you may be fined up to $500. Remember, the color
orange marks a work zone and means slow down and be alert.</p>

    <p><b>Rough Road, Bump, or Uneven Lanes:</b>

      These signs are used
when certain road conditions, such as loose gravel or road
construction, affect
the roadway surface
and create potentially
difficult conditions for
motorists, especially
motorcyclists.</p>

    <p><b>Road Construction Ahead â€“ Detour:</b>

      These signs indicate a change in the traffic pattern
or route ahead. Slow down. Unusual or
potentially dangerous conditions are ahead.


    <p><b>Flashing Arrow Panels:</b>

      Large flashing arrow
panels or flashing message signs in work zones
direct drivers to proceed into different traffic
lanes and inform them that part of the road
ahead is closed.</p>
