    <p> <h3> Traffic Signs</h3><p>
    <p><h4>The color and shape of a traffic sign</h4> communicates
    important information about the signâ€™s message. In poor
    visibility conditions, such as heavy fog, you may be able to
    make out only the shape of a sign. As you approach a sign
    and while still distant, you may see the color long before you
    can read the message or see the symbol, giving you some
    advance information.</p>
    <p><b>Sign Colors</b>
      <br>
      Sign colors help you know what the intention of the sign is.</p>
    <p>Red used with white conveys stop, yield, do not, and no. Stop
      signs, yield signs, do not enter or wrong way signs, the circle
      and slash in a no turn sign, and the restrictions in a parking sign
      are examples.</p>
    <p>
    Black used with white conveys regulatory information. Speed
    limit, do not pass, no turns are examples where the operation is
    regulated by law and the black and white sign would be found.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yellow used with black conveys a warning. Curve ahead,
    stop ahead, overhead clearances, slippery when wet, are all
    examples. A specialized class of warning signs uses a strong
    yellow/green color with black to advise of school zone activities
    and other pedestrian activities.</p>
