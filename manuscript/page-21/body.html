    <p><h4>Regulatory or guide signs</h4> inform you
of the law; you must obey their instructions.
Remember that a red circle with a slash means
NO — the symbol inside the circle tells you
what is prohibited.

    <p><b>Speed Limit: </b> These signs tell you the maximum
legal speed that you may drive on the road
where the sign is posted when weather
conditions are good.

    During rain, snow and ice,
you may receive a ticket for driving too fast for
the conditions even if you are driving at or less
than the posted speed limit.</p>
    <p><b>Do Not Enter – Wrong Way:</b>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamkisho/DMV-DL-Guide/master/assets/images/wrong_way.jpg" alt="Wrong Way Sign" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    These signs mean
you cannot drive in that direction. If you drive
past these signs you are going in the wrong
direction and could get into a head-on crash
with vehicles headed your way. Cautiously turn
around.</p>
    <p><b>One Way:</b>

    Traffic flows only in
the direction of the arrow.</p>
    <p><b>No Left Turn:</b>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamkisho/DMV-DL-Guide/master/assets/images/no_left_turn.jpg" alt="No Left Turn Sign" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    Left turns are against the law. In
Virginia, U-turns are considered as two left turns
and are illegal if this sign is posted.</p>
    <p><b>No Right Turn:</b>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamkisho/DMV-DL-Guide/master/assets/images/no_right_turn.jpg" alt="No Right Turn Sign" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    Right turns are illegal. Do not
make a right turn when you see this sign.</p>
