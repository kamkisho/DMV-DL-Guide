    At a green light, you may go if the way
is clear. At a green arrow, you may go in the direction of the
arrow if the way is clear. If you are turning, you must yield the
right-of-way to vehicles coming from the other direction and
pedestrians in the intersection. Be sure to check for less visible
vehicles such as motorcycles,
bicycles, and mopeds. If a traffic
light changes from red to green
while a pedestrian is in the street,
allow the pedestrian to cross the
street before turning.</p>
    <p><b>Out of service signals: </b>

    When traffic signals are not working
because of a power outage or other problem and not displaying
any lights, you are required to stop, proceeding through the
intersection as though it were an all-way stop. This does not
apply if a law enforcement officer or other authorized person is
directing traffic at the intersection, or if portable stop signs are
in use.</p>
