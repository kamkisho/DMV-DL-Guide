    <p><h4>Sign Shapes</h4> </p>
    <p><b>Octagon (Stop):</b> This eight-sided
shape always means stop. You must
come to a complete stop at the
sign, stop line, pedestrian crosswalk
or curb. Wait for any vehicle or
pedestrian to clear the way. At some intersections you’ll find
a sign beneath the stop sign that reads “All Way” or “4 Way.”
At these intersections all vehicles on all roads leading into the
intersection must stop. If you get to the intersection at the
same time as other vehicles, the driver on the left must yield
to the driver on the right.</p>
    <p><b>Triangle (Yield):</b> You must
slow down as you come to the
intersection. Be prepared to stop.
Let any vehicles, pedestrians or
bicyclists safely pass before you
proceed.</p>
    <p><b>Rectangle (Regulatory or Guide):</b>
      Vertical signs generally give
  instructions or tell you the law.
  Horizontal signs may give directions
  or information.</p>
    <p><b>Diamond (Warning):</b> These signs warn you
of special conditions or hazards ahead. Slow
down and drive with caution. Be ready to stop.</p>
    <p><b>Pentagon (School Zone/School
Crossing):</b>
This five-sided shape marks
school zones and warns you
about school crossings. Signs
may display horizontal lines
indicating the point at which a
crosswalk exists. Two signs may be used together
to show the actual location of the crosswalk.</p>
