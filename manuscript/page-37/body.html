      mean that passing on the left
      is allowed in either direction
      when the way ahead is clear.</p>

    <p><b>A broken yellow line
      alongside a solid yellow line</b>
      means that passing is allowed
      from the side of the broken
      line, but not from the side of
      the solid line.<br><br>

      Vehicles on the solid yellow
      line side may only cross the
      line to pass pedestrians,
      scooters or skateboards,
      bicyclists, and riders of
      when the opposite lane is
      clear and you can pass safely.</p>
