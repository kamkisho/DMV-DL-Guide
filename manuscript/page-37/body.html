      traveling at 25 MPH or less,
such as farm equipment and horse-drawn
vehicles, must display these signs when using
a public highway. Be prepared to adjust your
speed or position when you see a vehicle with
one of these signs.</p>

    <p><b>Pavement Markings</b>
      Road markings guide and warn drivers as well as regulate
      traffic. Markings may be red, blue, yellow or white. They
      may be used alone or in combinations. Each has a different
      meaning.</p>

    <p><b>Red markings</b>
       are generally not used; but, some communities
      do use red curbs to indicate no parking zones.</p>

    <p><b> Red reflectors</b> on the pavement show areas not to be entered
      or used. They are positioned on the road surface so that only
      traffic flowing in the wrong direction would observe them.

    <p><b>Blue markings</b> show parking spaces for persons with
      disabilities.</p>

    <p><b>Yellow center</b> lines mean two-way traffic, flowing in
      opposite directions.</p>
