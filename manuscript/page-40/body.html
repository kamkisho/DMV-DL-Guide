    <p><b>Dotted white lines</b> are actually small rectangles in a series
    where each is closely spaced to the next. They are used to
    show lane assignment in intersections and interchanges where
    there might otherwise be a tendency to drift out of a lane or
    an area of intended use. Often they are used to guide two
    turning lanes through the intersection. Dotted white lines
    are also used to denote the opening of a turn lane at an
    intersection and entrance/exit lanes at interchanges.</p>

    <p>Many two-lane roads in Virginia <b>do not have lane markings</b>
to separate the lanes. On an unmarked two-lane road, you
may pass a slow moving vehicle on the left side if there are no
signs prohibiting passing. Make sure that the way is clear.</p>

    <p><b>Solid white lines</b> show turn lanes and discourage lane
    changes near intersections, and at other locations where lane
    changes might
    be dangerous.
