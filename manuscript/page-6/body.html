          Those signs, lights and siren are making me more curious to drive here. But I must be cautious. My wife told me that I need to take a written test first and then a driving test on the road.
          I am like driving test is fine as I have enough experience, but what is this written test. She asked me to check DMV website i.e. Department of Motor Vehicles.

          Oh gosh, now I have to give 2 tests for getting my driving license here. <strong> Ain't that funny? </strong>

          I checked DMV website next day. They have 40 pages pdf...
          I feel like I'm turning 16.
