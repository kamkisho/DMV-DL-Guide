      My plane has just landed at Dulles Airport in Washington. I am full of excitement to meet my wife after a month since I saw her last and 24 hour journey from other corner of the world.
      When I told her that I am finally coming to states to live with header, she started making plans, a lot of plans actually. Long drives, late night movies, parties, dinners and daily office drop and pick up, just to spend more time with me.
      Now she'll enjoy her time while I would be driving the car, she had bought here in US. She is already calling me <strong>'The Driver'</strong> on the phone.
      I left my job, rented house and my first car, Hyundai Grand i10. It's been only 2 years and I already had driving experience of more than 32000 kms.
      I have got my international driving license issued.

      And Here she is, waiving her hand and cheering with my name. We hugged each other and I finally got to see the car, which I was eagerly waiting to try my hands on the roads of DC.
      I wanted to drive, but she asked me to give some time to adapt new surroundings and learn the rules of the road here.
